Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word of a phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words

EXAMPLE
Input: 'Tact Coa'
Output: True (permutations: 'taco cat', 'atco cat', etc)

Input: String
Output: Boolean
Constraints: optimize
Edge Case: empty string, spaces, more than two of same character, integers
